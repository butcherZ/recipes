# Spring Onion Oil Noodles 葱油面

#### a Spring Onion Oil Noodles recipe for vegans :P

### Ingredients:

- [ ] `Spring onion (ciboulette)`
- [ ] `Garlic` - 2 cloves
- [ ] `Ginger` - 1 slice `
- [ ] `Canelle` - 1 piece `
- [ ] `Star anise` - 1 or 2`
- [ ] `Cooking Oil` - 100 grams `// any, but DO NOT use olive oil`

- [ ] `Light Soy Sauce` - 25 grams
- [ ] `Dark Soy Sauce` - 10 grams
- [ ] `Sugar` - 10 grams `// you can put any amount you'd like, really depends on your own taste`

- [ ] `thin chinese noodles` - as much as you'd like :P`

### Steps:

1.  Wash of the dirt of `spring onions`, and dry them out (_!important_, otherwise the remain water will cause an expolosion later in the hot oil).
2.  Warm up the `cooking oil` with medium heat, then put `Garlic`, `Ginger`, `Star anise`, `Canelle` and `Ciboulette` in the pan / pot, once you smell the aroma of these spices, turn the fire to gentle heat.
3.  Let the ingreditents simmered in oil, until the `Ciboulettes` turned dry and dark brown-ish (it would take about 20 minutes, if the color changed too fast, it might means the heat is too high, then we risk overcooking them), remove all the ingredients from the pan / pot (or not, you can actually store them with the oil later).
4.  Add `Light Soy Sauce`, `Dark Soy Sauce` and `Sugar`, stir for 1 - 2 minutes, then turn off the fire.

5.  While letting the oil cool down a bit, you can start cooking the chinese noodles, it normally takes 3 - 4 minutes to be fully cooked (taking more time than that would result in the noodles becoming too soggy). Once the noodles are cooked, try to drain as much as water out of it, then add the `spring onion oil` directly in the noodle while the noodles are still hot, mix it well, and Bon appetit! :wink:
